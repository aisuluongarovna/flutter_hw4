↪   A `ListView` in Flutter is like a scrollable list where you can display a bunch of items vertically or horizontally. It's great for showing lots of information without taking up too much space on the screen, and it keeps things running smoothly even with a lot of items.

↪  The app presents a scrollable list showcasing users and their respective companies. Each user entry includes their name, company, and icons indicating contact and identity. Tapping a user triggers a log message, while a long-press initiates a "call" action (represented by a log message).
